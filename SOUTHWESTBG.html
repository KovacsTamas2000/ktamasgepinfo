Flaming Fist Headquarters Edit
The Flaming Fist HQ is the big building in the northwest corner of the map. The following NPCs can be found in or near it.
<BR>
Duke Eltan, one of the four grand dukes of Baldur's Gate.
<BR>
Tiax is standing outside across from the gates. He is a potential companion and a multiclass Cleric/Thief. He is obsessed with world
 domination and believes the player is the one to help him.
<BR>
Scar, the second in command of the Flaming Fist, can be found inside or by the gates.
<BR>
<BR>
Ye Olde Inn Edit
The white building near the Flaming Fist HQ is Ye Olde Inn. The inn offers drinks, beds in all four room types, and it has a slime problem.
<BR>
ÍBR>
Seven Suns Edit
The building south with the brown and grey roof is the Seven Suns. Scar will ask you to investigate the suspicious activities from the
 guild.
<BR>
<BR>
Merchants' League Estate Edit
The large building down left from the Seven Suns is the building for the Merchants' League. This building is not accessible if the player
 killed Aldeth Sashenstar, a member of the league, in the Cloakwood area. However, if the player helped Aldeth Sashenstar instead they may
 enter and Aldeth will approach the player and give them a quest to help him figure out whats up with his business partners. The reward is
 a magic sword, 100 gold, possibilities of help later, and a lot of xp.
<BR>
<BR>
Tavern and Inn Edit
One of the three buildings in the southwest corner of the map is a generic tavern that is home to Phandalyn, an overzealous paladin who
 will attack any party that enters whilst containing even one member with an Evil alignment. Killing him in self defense will cause the
 party to lose 3 Reputation.
<BR>
<BR>
Sunin's Home Edit
The central building of the three in the southwest corner of the map (the one with the cross-shaped balcony) is inhabited by the mage
 Sunin who doesn't like intruders. He will drop a Ring of Wizardry, if he is killed.
<BR>
<BR>
General StoresEdit
There are three general stores in this area. One is in the southwest corner of the map, sitting closest to the south and just across from
 the Merchants' League Estate. A second is just behind the Merchants' League Estate, on the opposite side of the street to the first. The
 final one is located behind the Seven Suns building, just opposite to Ye Olde Inn. A fourth one is the Potion Shop at the back of the
 latter and of the Seven Suns.
