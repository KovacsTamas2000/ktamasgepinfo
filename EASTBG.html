Lucky Aello's. All cursed potions are colored differently than their normal counterparts, except for one; all of Aello's potions are cursed except for the Potion of Perception, with its boost to Thief skills.
Keexie Tavern, AR0154. Just a tavern, nothing special about it.
<br>
<br>
Thieves' Guild AR0153. Talk to Niklos at 1550, 1790, gives an invitation to the Thieves' Guild, and more importantly, the password, 'Fafhrd'. After accepting the quest from Alatos to steal the plans and other means of creating airships from Oberan's Estate in Central Baldur's Gate, the party will be given free run of the Thieves' Guild.
Black Lily sells mostly items Thieves can use, but also a Fighter potion.
<br>
<br>
Manual of Quickness of Action, permanent +1 Dexterity behind Black Lily.
Narlen Darkwalk.
Sorcerous Sundries AR0703. Spells and the like, and the proprietor will also turn the Nymph Hair from the Captive Nymph quest (starts in north Baldur's Gate) into a Nymph Cloak (like the one Algernon in Beregost has). If the party already has Algernon's Cloak, they may wish to give the new one to Pheirkas, in the house south of where Skie Silvershield is found. The reward is low, though.
Maltz' Weapon Shop, 1st floor AR0803
Arkion in locked house AR0805 at 1600, 3200. Collect for his experiments, one corpse from the sewers. The objective is the East Sewers, and opinions vary about the quickest way there; the closest should be the grating just northeast of the Sorcerous Sundries shop, and then once down, heading East. However, the cocoons, whether of spiders or carrion crawlers, do not seem to be where they are supposed to be. So the next nearest would be the grating closest to the Seven Suns in southwest Baldur's Gate, which exits next to a bathtub with a floater. Head to southeast Baldur's Gate to find Nemphre. Give Arkion's Bloodstone Amulet and Nemphre's Onyx Ring to Ordulinian in Sorcerous Sundries -3500 XP, Cloak of Non-Detection.
Elfsong Tavern AR0705
<br>
<br>
First floor
Brevlik wants the party to steal a telescope from the Hall of Wonders and give to a collector. This leads to a potential companion, Alora
<br>
<br>
Second floor
Merchant
Alyth Elendara - proprietor, will not speak to those with a reputation lower than 8.
Cyrdemac - Is the target of the Contract Killer side quest. Kill him for Areana in north Baldur's Gate , and blackmail her for the full reward, or Charm her for the first part of the reward.
Shop of Silence, near the east wall, close to Elfsong Tavern.
