<h1>What is Baldur's Gate?</h1>

<p class="prgrph">Baldur's Gate is a fantasy role-playing video game using Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules and
set in the high fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms. It was developed by BioWare, the first game
to use their Infinity Engine, and was originally released for PC in 1998. It was followed by an
expansion pack, Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast in 1999. A sequel, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows
of Amn, was released in 2000 and an expansion to the sequel, Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, in 2001.
On November 28, 2012, Overhaul Games released Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, an updated and improved
version of the original game, incorporating the expansion and new content. It was followed by Baldur's
Gate II: Enhanced Edition on November 15, 2013. On March 31, 2016, Overhaul Games' parent company, Beamdog,
released Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear, an expansion to Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, closing the
gap between the first and the second part of the saga. On June 6, 2019, Larian Studios and Wizards of the
Coast announced Baldur's Gate III which will use the modern 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons rules.
