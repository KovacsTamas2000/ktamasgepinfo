<p>Ragefast's Home is locked.Though there are others that seem reasonable enough at first glance, there is only one dialogue path that
 leads to the Nymph Abela's freedom. The first two choices between answers are straightforward enough; the primary rationale is that 
Ragefast does care what happens to Abela, if only because he cannot have her. So mentioning Ramazith is just out of the question. Most
 of these speeches imply the player is taking her to another confinement, which means the only motivation is the reward from Ragefast, not
 freeing Abela. Option 3 to the third comment; "Your twisted feelings cloud your sight! Release her before you both come to harm!", seems a
s good as the 'winning' answer 1, "One does not cage those he cares for! You may break her spirit and she will serve you, but this is not
 love! Listen to her!", but the latter is more specific, and does not contain the hint of violence in the former. The second option for the
 third choice that says that the player character intends to "release her under the sight of Ramazith", as though to set her free and have
 Ramazith witness her release, but this is equivocal, and Ragefasowould be too jealous of Ramazith anyway, so this is not a good plan
 either. The only path that does not lead to battle is 2, 2, 1, 3

Varci Roaringhorn at 1040, 825, entreats the party to help him save his friend, Casson Belde'ar; follow him to his house at 875, 666.
 Inside, his friend's father, priest of Tymora, Tremain Belde'ar, explains. Casson was risking more than he thought when he trespassed on
 the temple grounds of the Bitch Queen Umberlee, goddess of sea storms; the priestesses killed him for this crime, and Tremain wants the 
body so he can resurrect the child. For players who do not wish to kill the priestesses or pay the 2000 gold they demand, now would be a 
good time to make the two round trips between the fishermen in Area North of the Friendly Arm, and Tenya in Wyrm's Crossing to retrieve 
the Umberlee priestess' Elemental Control talisman. Umberlee's temple is in south Baldur's Gate; see that article for more on this quest 
and related quests.<br>
Varci gives a reward of 5000 XP, 2000 GP, and a Large Shield +1 +4 vs. Missiles reward after Casson has been revived and the Belde'ars make
 to leave. His voice file, "Please help, tis a wasted life at stake", will play forever, anytime he is selected, but has no dialogue after
 his final speech.<br>
All of the bookcases with the important loot can be looted, but unlocking the chest downstairs with a minor Bluestone Necklace and even
 opening the one upstairs with petty gold and a minor book summons Flaming Fist guards. Free loot downstairs: two quest books History of
 the Darkness (as titled on the cover, hovering the cursor over it; right clicking it gives the text and full title inside; give to
 Ulcaster, 1000XP) and History of the Unicorn Run (Rinnie in north Baldur's Gate). Upstairs is just sell loot: History of the Heartlands
 and History of the Zentarim.
<br>
<br>
The Lady's Hall (Temple of Tymora) - Chanthalas Ulbright will sell the Tome of Understanding for 500GP to players on the quest to obtain
 Lothander's cure. Cheap, but it can be free to players with 15 or more Reputation. Chanthalas Ulbright also offers temple services.
<br>
<br>
Hall of Wonders, the western of the two columned Grecian temple-like buildings. Alora is stealing here in the evening. She asks for aid
 from parties of 8 or more Reputation. Help her and gain her as a party member.
<br>
<br>
High House of Wonders, east building actually is a Temple, dedicated to Gond. The would-be poet Forthel here is searching for material;
 he can be rebuffed or aided, but he disdains two of the player character's quite lengthy and workable offerings and abhors the others;
 for the second and fourth ideas that he only disdains, he will give 4GP and go back to composing poems about his laundering difficulties. The priest offers typical temple services.
