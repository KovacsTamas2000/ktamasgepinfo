<p>Entar Silvershield's Estate, in the northwest corner, the house of one of the four Grand Dukes in Baldur's Gate. Although there are
 some valuable items to find, there no special items. Also, if Eldoth is in your party, your party is able to recruit Skie Silvershield,
 a companion and the daughter of the Grand Duke.
<BR>
<BR>
Helm and Cloak Inn, southeast part of the area, is a luxurious inn. The Merry Fools can be found here and after talking to them, another
 group of adventurers walk in, who are a bit rough. One member of the group drops Battle Axe of Mauletar.
<BR>
<BR>
Degrodel's Home, which is guarded by hostile creatures, greet you when entering his house. If you talk to Degrodel, after slaying them,
 the party can start the Searching for Balduran's Helmet side quest.
<BR>
<BR>
One of the houses here is inhabitated by twins, there you can start another side quest which may give you the Wand of Polymorphing as a
 reward.
<BR>

An unnamed inn north of the Helm and Cloak. Not much to there.
