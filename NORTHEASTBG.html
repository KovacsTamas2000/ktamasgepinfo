Narlen Darkwalk is outside the Splurging Sturgeon for the first of his tests; see East Baldur's Gate. The Thief of the party must give warning as a Flaming Fist guard approaches; the party should return to the Thieves' Guild. Killing the guard will result in a lesser reward; failing to give warning or setting the guard on the thieves will instead make Narlen hostile if he is then encountered at the Thieves' Guild
Brielbara is outside, between the Blushing Mermaid and the Splurging Sturgeon. Her daughter has been cursed by Yago. Coran is the father of the child, and will leave the party if the player refuses to aid Brielbara. Go to south Baldur's Gate and retrieve Yago's book of curses from the floating tavern, the Low Lantern. Meet her inside the Splurging Sturgeon with the book for 1000 XP, Reputation +1, 200 GP. Trying to get out of the quest makes her attack.
